# QuestLogger
 
Unitypackage for logging movement tracked by Meta Quest headsets locally in tab separated text files.


To be added to Unity projects using Meta's OVRPlugin. See [https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-tutorial-hello-vr/](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-tutorial-hello-vr/)

Usage:
1. Download and import the .unitypackage
2. Drag the MovementLogger prefab into a scene already cointaining a OVRCameraRig, and OVRHand/OVRController prefabs.
   - This should automatically populate the necessary fields of the QuestLogger: OVRManager, left- and right-hand,  and head attachments.
3. Build and run on headset.
